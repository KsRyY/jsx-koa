# jsx-koa

!> This project is still at its early stage of development. Although its API is mostly stable, I cannot approve that it is safe to use in production. Also, the document is incomplete, so use with caution.

> This project is inspired by [jsxmock](https://github.com/ivan-94/jsxmock), which is a work of a Chinese developer. If you are interested and you can understand Chinese, go have a look!

jsx-koa is a wrapper of Koa for you to use JSX to write Koa Apps.

- **Easy to learn.** No new concepts are introduced (_except_ JSX if you are not familiar with React)
- **Reusable Ecosystem.** You are able to use anything from the Koa.js ecosystem frictionlessly.
- **React-like Components.** Build components just like what React does (function components only)
